      <p>
        What can I say? It's a pain to figure out the value of cards. Looked for
        a way to make things simpler... for myself. Now you can too. Here at
        ____, we make sure that it's easier to know the true value of your
        cards. Value changes in real time and we want to make sure you're all
        caught up. Unsure of what you have in your hand? Scan it, post an image,
        type the title. You'll be sure to find it here, if not well... we're
        working on it but be sure to submit an image. Now, if you decide to
        sell/ buy through our direct site; it does take longer to make sure it's
        authenticated before it gets to you. You can even send your cards in to
        get it graded to TRULY know your worth!
